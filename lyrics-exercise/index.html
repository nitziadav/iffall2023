            [Intro] 
            Three, two, one 
             
            [Verse 1] 
            I, I took a trip 
            Straight through the sky 
            Aimed for the stars, but I got stuck in space 
            Feel out of place 
            So, I 
            I head out west 
            To manifest my destiny 
            Vampires and valley girls (Oh my god!) 
            It's a wicked world 
             
            [Chorus] 
            And I break down 
            Till I have a break through it all 
            Nothing matters, it's not real 
            Who cares 
            We're a floating rock in some space 
            So leave a message, I'm not here 
             
            [Verse 2] 
            You, you came along 
            And got me out 
            In this rescue rocket, but too late (too late) 
            Crushed by the weight 
             
            
            [Chorus] 
            And I break down 
            Till I have a break through it all 
            Nothing mattеrs, it's not real 
            Who cares 
            We'rе a floating rock in some space 
            So leave a message, I'm not here 
             
            [Bridge] 
            Ooh, tell me what you mean (what you mean) 
            'Cause all that I believe (I believe) 
            Is love and gravity (gravity) 
            Are never what they seem 
             
            [Outro] 
            And I break down 
            Till I have a break through it all 
            Nothing matters, it's not real
