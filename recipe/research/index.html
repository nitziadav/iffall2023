        <h1>RECIPE for Pozole</h1>
            <p>Pozole is basically a cross between a soup and a stew and is popular around the country, especially on events such as Mexican Independence Day and at Christmas, and most people associate it with any large family gathering. Pretty much all pozoles contain the base ingredients of pork, garlic and large hominy kernels (cacahuazintle), although there are several versions that use meats such as chicken instead, plus the added extras of shredded lettuce, hot sauce, diced onion, thinly sliced radish, a healthy squeeze of lime and avocado. Itâ€™s often served with tostadas.</p>

                <h1>instructions</h1>
                
                    <ol type="1">
                            <li> Start by wiping off the dried chiles, then de-stemming and de-seeding them. Give the chile pieces a quick roast in a 400F oven for 1-2 minutes. Add the roasted chile pieces to a bowl, cover them with hot tap water, and let them reconstitute for 20-30 minutes or until you need them. </li>
                            
                            <li> Finely chop an onion and add it to a large soup pot along with a glug of oil. Cook the onion over medium heat until softened and then add 6 minced garlic cloves. Briefly cook the garlic. Scoop about half of this onion-garlic mixture into a blender where it will become part of the chile puree, and leave the other half in the soup pot. </li>
                            
                            <li> Add 8 cups of stock to the pot along with the drained and rinsed hominy. I used two 30 oz. cans of hominy for this batch and that will make your Pozole a bit more chunky. For a brothier Pozole use just a single can of hominy. </li>
                            
                            <li> Before draining the chiles be sure to take a taste of the soaking liquid. If you like the taste then you can use it to make the chile puree. If it tastes bitter to you then discard it and use stock to blend the chiles (that's what I did for this batch). Note: if you like the flavor of the chiles' soaking liquid you are also welcome to use more of it for the Pozole broth in place of stock. </li> 
                            
                            <li> Drain the chiles and add them to the blender. Half of the onion-garlic mixture should already be in the blender. Add 2 cups of stock and combine well. Add the chile puree to the soup pot. You can optionally strain the chile puree to remove any seeds or bits of skin, but lately I skip this step. </li>
                            
                            <li> Add the remaining spices to the soup pot: 1 tablespoon Mexican oregano, 1/2 teaspoon cumin, a pinch of ground clove (optional), a pinch of ground cinnamon (optional), some freshly cracked black pepper, and 1 teaspoon salt. I also added 1/2 cup uncooked white rice and some diced carrots, but this is optional. Stir well and bring to a boil. Lower heat to maintain a simmer, cover, and let simmer for 20-25 minutes. </li>
                            
                            <li> Be sure to take a final taste for seasoning! I added another generous pinch of salt to this batch, but keep in mind that salt level will depend on which stock you're using. I used a low sodium homemade stock and had to add 2 heaping teaspoons of salt to this batch, but if using store-bought stock you won't need to add as much salt as I did. </li>
                            
                            <li> Serve immediately with your choice of garnish. I topped with thinly sliced cabbage that was tossed with lime juice and salt, avocado slices, serrano chile slices, and freshly chopped cilantro. </li>
                            
                            <li> Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge where it will keep for a few days. To reheat simply add Pozole to a saucepan over medium heat and cook until simmering. If it seems thick when re-heating I will typically add a splash of stock (or water) to thin it out. </li>

                        <p>Food Network website homebase is very imagery heavy which is effective in terms of recipe websites because it makes them alluring. The recipes themselves are also well organized and orgonazied with mutiple columns on the page instead of scrolling up and down.</p>

                        <p> This is a recipe from a chef named Dora Stone. The website is more of a blog so has a personal touch for recipes which is effective for the purpose of the site since it is all about vegan/vegetarain Mexican cuisine thus the personality behind the website gives the recipes a degree of authenticity. The recipe pages are also useful in that they have a compact dtlr of the insturctions at the end of the page with a printable layout.</p>

                        <p> This website larger inventory is divided by categrories beyond the basic divisions which can get more engagement. The recipes have a vertical empahasis with the typical scroll down use though ingredients do remain in a columns beside the instructions which can be useful when actually cooking</p>

                        <p>This website is a bit cahotic for my vision of the recipe site hwoever I do like the creative liberties such as the vibrant colors and animated features.</p>

                        <p> I did not know what to reference so amazon item reviews came to mind but the use of viewer engagemnt would be interesting so shaing either the completed recipe or little differences done by each person who made the recipe.</p>

                        <p> Also could not find a better example but the referenceing to local shops of ingredients in the recipe such as target does to see if an item is available near you could be useful and higlight local businesses.</p>
